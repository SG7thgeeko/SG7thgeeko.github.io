            <h1>⚪The area of the region, enclosed by the circle x2 + y2 = 2 which is not common to the region bounded by the parabola y2 = 𝑥 and the straight line 𝑦 = 𝑥, is</h1>
             
<p>Correct Answer: (1/6)(12𝜋 − 1)</p><br>
Explanation:Required area = area of the circle – area bounded by given line and parabola<br>

            <h1>⚪ Total number of six-digit numbers in which only and all the five digits 1,3,5,7 and 9 appear, is</h1> 
        <p>Correct Answer: (5/2) 6! </p><br>  
        Explanation: Selecting all 5 digits = 5C5 = 1 way <br>
        Now, we need to select one more digit to make it a 6 digit number = 5C1 = 5 ways<br>
        Total number of permutations = 6!/2!<br>
        Total numbers = 5C5×5C1×(6!/2!)<br>
        = (5/2) 6!<br>

            <h1>⚪ If Re (z-1)/(2z + i) = 1, where z = x+iy, then the point (x,y) lies on a</h1> 
        <p>Correct  circle whose diameter is √5/2 </p> <br> 
        Explanation:z = x + iy <br>
        x+iy−1/2x+2iy+i = (x−1)+iy/2x+i(2y+1)(2x−i(2y+1)/2x−i(2y+1))<br>
        2x(x−1)+y(2y+1)/4x^2+(2y+1)^2 = 1<br>
        2x^2 + 2y^2 - 2x + y = 4x^2 + 4y^2 + 4y + 1 <br>
        x^2 + y^2 + x + (3/2)y + (1/2) = 0 <br>
        Circle’s centre will be (-1/2, -3/4)<br>
        Radius = √[(1/4) + (9/16) - (1/2)] = √5/4<br>
        Diameter = √5/2<br>

            <h1>⚪ If the distance between the foci of an ellipse is 6 and the distance between its directrices is 12, then the length of its latus rectum is: </h1> 
        <p>Correct Answer: 3√2 </p>  <br>
       Explanation: Let the equation of ellipse be<br>
       x2/a2 + y2/b2 = 1<br>
       a>b<br>
       Now 2ae = 6<br>
       2a/e = 12<br>
       ae = 3 and a/e = 6<br>
       a2 = 18<br>
       a2e2 = c2 = a2-b2 = 9<br>
       b2 = 9<br>
       length of latus rectum = 2b2/a = 2×9/√18 = 3√2<br>
