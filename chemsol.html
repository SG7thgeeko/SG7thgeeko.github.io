            <h1>⚪ What is the maximum theoretical energy efficiency of a fuel cell?</h1>
             
<p>Correct Answer: 83 %</p><br>
Explanation: E°cell of an H2-O2 fuel cell = 1.23 V and ΔH=-285.8 kJ mol-1 <br>
ΔG = -n x F x E°cell = -2 x 96500 x 1.23 <br>
= -237390 J mol-1 <br>
= -237.390 kJ mol-1 <br>
Efficiency = ΔG/ΔH x 100 <br>
= -237.390/-285.8 x 100 <br>
= 83%. <br>

            <h1>⚪ What is the concentration of the reactant in a first order reaction when the rate of the reaction is 0.6 s-1 and the rate constant is 0.035?</h1> 
        <p>Correct Answer: 17.143 M </p><br>  
        Explanation: Given, R=0.6 s-1 and k= 0.035 <br>
        For a first order reaction R= k [A] <br>
        [A]=Rk = 0.60.035 = 17.143 M. <br>

            <h1>⚪  Molecular mass of polymers are expressed as a/an _______ </h1> 
        <p>Correct Answer: Average </p> <br> 
        Explanation: The length of polymer and their molecular mass depends on the number of monomers available for reaction. As a result, the chain lengths of polymers are varying and are expressed as an average <br>

            <h1>⚪ What is the term used to refer to the number of collisions per unit volume of the reaction mixture?</h1> 
        <p>Correct Answer: Collision frequency </p> <br> 
        Explanation: The number of collisions per unit volume of the reaction mixture is known as collision frequency. According to this theory, the reactant molecules are assumed to be hard spheres and reaction is postulated to occur when molecules collide with each other.The number of collisions per unit volume of the reaction mixture is known as collision frequency.

            <h1>⚪ Which of the following is not a crystal system? </h1> 
        <p>Correct Answer: Hexaclinic </p>  <br>
       Explanation: Hexaclinic is not a crystal system. Their crystal system are cubic, tetragonal, rhombohedral or trigonal, orthorhombic or rhombic, monoclinic, triclinic and hexagonal.<br>
