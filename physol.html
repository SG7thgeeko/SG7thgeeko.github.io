            <h1>⚪When a body performs a U.C.M. it has__________</h1> 
        <p>Correct Answer: an acceleration of constant magnitude but variable direction </p><br>  
        Explanation:
         The product of mass and square of the magnitude of velocity of the body, since mass and magnitude of the velocity is a constant value in case of uniform motion, so the magnitude of kinetic energy remains constant during the motion. So, Kinetic energy remains constant in uniform circular motion.

            <h1>⚪  When a body performs a U.C.M.</h1> 
        <p>Correct Answer: Work done on it 1s zero</p> <br> 
        Explanation: Force in uniform circular motion is always perpendicular to the displacement and hence the angle between F and S is 900 always. After putting the value of θ. W=0. Hence, The work done in a uniform circular motion is always zero.<br>
